    <h2 class="title">1. Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      SDShare is a protocol for the syndication of resource descriptions. It defines how a RESTful service can publish a series of feeds that list snapshots and changes to collections of resources. This protocol also defines how a client should process those feeds and the linked resource descriptions so that a local store is in sync. [[next sentence is not needed]]A client can synchronize with more than one server to act as an aggregator for resource descriptions.

    <h2>3. Concepts</h2>

    <p>This protocol defines the following hierarchy of Atom feeds published by a server to expose one or more collection(s) of resource descriptions:
    <ul>
        <li>An overview feed which lists the collections of semantic descriptions that the server exposes.</li>
        <li>A collection feed for each collection of semantic descriptions that each links to a corresponding snapshots feed and a corresponding fragments feed</li>
        <li>A snapshots feed for each collection. Each snapshot represents the state of a collection at point of time</li>
        <li>A fragments feed for each collection. Each fragment is created because it is the new representation of a topic that has changed. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    The protocol also specifies how a client should interpret and process these feeds in order to syndicate the server's semantic descriptions. A client that wishes to maintain a local semantic collection in sync with one held on the server first fetches the most recent snapshot for the required collection. It then subscribes to the feed of change fragments for that collection. This feed lists fragments of which each represent one or more changes in the underlying semantic collection. These fragments are created and an entry added to the feed when a topic is updated, added or deleted from the collection. The next time the client pulls the feed it updates its local collection with the new version of the topic.</p>

    <p class="note">NOTE: the notion of a client and server is solely defined by the responsibilities of each. Thus a given machine can act both as client and server (peer-to-peer scenario) or restrict itself to exactly one of the roles (publish-subscribe scenario).</p>

    <p class="note">NOTE: The term “topic” refers in this specification to any reification of a given semantic description.</p>

    <p>The protocol provides no provision against malicious or broken servers. It requires the client to trust all upstream servers.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3 class="title">4.1. Terminology</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Server Node: A source of semantic descriptions that hosts both feed and data services so other nodes can observe and understand the state of the collection being managed over time.</li>
          <li>Client Node: A node that subscribes to one or more server nodes and implements the update semantics defined in this protocol.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>    
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3 class="title">4.2. Server Contract</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Server Node: A source of semantic descriptions that hosts both feed and data services so other nodes can observe and understand the state of the collection being managed over time.</li>
          <li>Client Node: A node that subscribes to one or more server nodes and implements the update semantics defined in this protocol.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>    

        <p>A server node is responsible for providing information about the state of the collection(s) it is managing. It provides a number of feeds that allow clients to see which aspects of the map have changed over time and data services that allow a client to fetch representations of the collection or individual topic instances in order to update a client environment.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3 class="title">4.3. Feeds & Data Services</h3>
        <p>A compliant server will provide the following Atom 1.0 feeds, fragment data services and snapshot data services.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h4 class="title">4.3.1. Overview Feed</h4>
            <p>The overview feed lists all collections of semantic descriptions that are being managed by the server.</p>

            <p>The collections feed comprises a feed with between 0 - N feed items. Each feed item represents a collection of semantic descriptions that are being exposed by this server.</p>

            <p>Each  collection feed item is required to have the mandatory ATOM feed item properties and MUST contain:
            <ul>
                <li>A link element with the following attributes; rel='http://www.egovpt.org/sdshare/collectionfeed', type='application/atom+xml' and href whose value links to the collection feed for that collection.</li>
                <li>An updated element whose value is the date time of the most recently updated item being exposed by the collection.</li>
            </ul>            
            </p>

            <pre>            
Example: 

Http request for server http://sdshare.org:
GET /collections

The Atom payload of the overview feed contains an entry for each separate semantic collection. 
Each entry has a link to an Atom feed for the specified collection.

            <h4 class="title">4.3.2. Collection Feed</h4>   
        
            <p>A collection feed is a feed for a specified collection of resource descriptions. A feed of this kinds lists exactly two entries, one entry linking to a snapshots feed and one to a fragments feed.</p>
            
            <!-- do we still want this dependency stuff? It does have its place. e.g. instance data referencing a schema. -->
            <p>Through one or more share:dependency elements the collection feed can optionally declare dependencies on other collection feeds from this or other servers that should be recursively processed before the current one.</p>

            <p>
The Atom payload of the response contains the two entries, one that links to a feed with all snapshots of the collection (rel-attribute of the link is http://www.egovpt.org/sdshare/snapshotsfeed), and another one that links to an Atom feed that lists change fragments to the collection (rel-attribute of the link is http://www.egovpt.org/sdshare/fragmentsfeed). Optionally, both links can be duplicated in the entries with rel-attributes that have the value alternate. This helps Atom feed readers to correctly display the links.

            <h4>4.3.4. Resources Feed</h4>
            <p>The resources feed is an ATOM 1.0 feed. The entries of the feed list resources that have changed in a given time period. </p>

            <p>The resources feed service accepts an optional request parameter since, which is used to specify that the client only wishes to see entries for fragments produced after the time given in the parameter. The effect of this parameter is to remove from the response body <entry> elements with timestamps in the atom:updated element older than the given time. </p>

            <p>Note that links to the service in the collection feed will not include this parameter. Clients must therefore add it to the URL themselves should they wish to use it. The value of the parameter is a datetime value matching the format specified in section 3.3 of the Atom specification.</p>

            <p>The Atom payload contains an entry for each fragment. Each entry contains one link to the fragment and the updated element contains the time at which the fragment was created. In addition to the standard Atom elements this protocol introduces two new elements.

    The new elements are:

        &lt;ServerSrcLocatorPrefix>: Indicates to a client the prefix to use to locate topic properties that should be removed when updating a semantic description. This element should occur once as a child element of the <feed> and before the first entry. (See the fragment update algorithm below for more information.) 

    and

        &lt;TopicSI>: Indicates to a client which topic is being updated from all those present in the fragment. This element MUST occur at least once as a child element of each <entry>. (See the fragment update algorithm below for more information). More than one TopicSI element can be specified.

                A collection fragment can be represented as a valid XTM 1.0, XTM 2.0 or RDF/XML document.

                The generation of fragments for feeds with RDF/XML payload is described in the RDF subsection below.

                A fragment for a feed with XTM 1.0 or XTM 2.0 payload is created in the context of one or more topics. The following algorithm should be applied when generating a fragment for given topic:

                    Let 'export' mean to create an XTM representation of the TMDM construct
                    Let T be the topic being exported.
                    export T including ALL topicnames, identifiers, and occurrences.
                    for each topicname in T export a topic stub for each name type (if it exists)
                    for each topicname in T export a topic stub for each scope topic (if it exists)
                    for each occurrence in T export a topic stub for the occurrence type (if it exists)
                    for each occurrence in T export a topic stub for each scope topic (if it exists)
                    for each association A in which T plays a role export the association
                    for each association A export a topic stub for the association type
                    for each association A export a topic stub for each topic scope topic
                    for each role R in A export a topic stub for the role type and one for the role player UNLESS the role player is T 

                For each stub topic exported (the following minimum must be exported)

                    export ALL of the topic's identifiers 

                ALL topics (stub or not) MUST have at least one Subject Identifier.

                A server may choose to export more information in the fragment, what is described here is the minimum required.

    Merge in the fragment TF using SP as the base all generated source locators.

    NOTE: To deprecate a topic publish an empty topic

    NOTE: The understanding is that each name, occurrence and association created or modified during the update will in its internal, TMDM-conformant representation have or get item identifiers that act as source locators and start with the ServerSrcLocatorPrefix.

4.5. RDF payload

This protocol is agnostic to the nature of the semantic payload. This section describes how the protocol works when the payload used is RDF.

    NOTE: While the protocol is payload agnostic, it does not describe how to interoperate between different semantic payload representations. 

4.5.1. The Fragment Generation Algorithm

To create a RDF fragment for a given entity uses the following algorithm:

For a given Resource

    Let T be the topic (a logical thing) being exported.
    Let R be the resource that identifies T
    Let S be the set of statements that comprise T
    Let 'export' mean to create a RDF representation of a graph of statements linked to the RDF resource. This graph is treated as a logical unit for the purposes of this algorithm 

4.5.2. The Fragment Update Algorithm

    Let SP be the value of the ServerSrcLocatorPrefix element in the Atom feed F
    feed F contains E
    entry E references fragment TF
    Let LC be the local collection
    Let R be the resource in LC that has a Resource URI that matches the SI
    For all statements where R is either the Subject or the Object of the statement STAT

        Delete all SrcLocators of STAT that begin with SP
        If the count of srclocators on STAT = 0 then delete TMC 
    Merge in the fragment TF using SP as the base all generated source locators. 

The above algorithm talks about the SrcLocators of a Statement. This is not an inherant property in the RDF data model. This is a required extension for the RDF payload. All Statements are defined as a subtype of Resource. Thus each RDF statement (as a Resource) MUST have a list property that is a set of URI's. This property is called 'SrcLocators' and is used as described above.

        <h2>6. Deployment Guidelines and Best Practices (informative)</h2>
        <p>This document defines no normative rules for the correct deployment of network topologies that build on it. However, this section proposes a few best practices to handle recurrent deployment issues.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>6.1. Trust and Security</h3>
        
            <p>The protocol assumes that the syndication of semantic descriptions happens with trusted servers. Importing descriptions from untrusted, potentially malicious sources can have serious repercussions including corrupting the client's data. If the protocol is used in P2P scenarios where every node acts both as server and client, this implies that all partners need to trust each other.</p>

            <p>Should the protocol be used to syndicate confidential data, it can be combined with end-to-end encryption between nodes, typically over https. Furthermore, it can leverage existing authentication mechanisms such as basic access authentication over http or https. In particularly sensitive cases it can also be employed over dedicated network connections.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>6.2. Extensions: Atom Publishing</h3>
            <p>The protocol does not define a mechanism for the client to update information on the server. However, valid use cases for such behaviour exist, e.g. in the case of local editing that is the pushed back on the server. The Atom Publishing Protocol is a good way to implement such behaviour, and a second revision of this CWA could contain a detailed specification for using it for this purpose.</p>
