    <p>
      SDShare is a protocol for the syndication of resource descriptions. It defines how a RESTful service can publish a series of feeds that list snapshots and changes to collections of resources. This protocol also defines how a client should process those feeds and the linked resource descriptions so that a local store is in sync.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>RDF provides a very flexible data model that allows data of any form to be represented. The existing RDF family of standards define how to serialise the model, how to query the model (SPARQL) and how to update the model (SPARQL Update). However, there are no protocols that define how a machine can both expose and consume RDF in a system of interconnected nodes. A classic use case for this requirement is where one RDF server contains collection of master data and another RDF system wishes to use that data. The master data will change over time. This protocol defines how the master data server can publish the changes to the resources it manages and how a client can consume them to ensure it is in sync.</p>

    <p>A SDShare server should publish the following hierarchy of Atom feeds to expose one or more collection(s) of resource descriptions:
    <ul>
        <li>An overview feed which lists the collections of resource descriptions that the server exposes.</li>
        <li>A collection feed for each collection of resource descriptions that each links to a corresponding snapshots feed and a corresponding fragments feed.</li>
        <li>A snapshots feed for each collection. Each snapshot represents the state of a collection at point of time.</li>
        <li>A resouce update feed for each collection. Each feed entry exists to reflect that the referenced resource has been updated. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    SDShare also specifies how a client should interpret and process these feeds in order to consume the resource descriptions. A client that wishes to maintain a local resource collection in sync with one held on the server first fetches the most recent snapshot for the required collection. It then subscribes to the update feed for that collection. This feed lists the resource whose state has changed in the underlying resource collection. A client can retrieve the RDF for a updated resource and update its local collection.</p>

    <p class="note">NOTE: the notion of a client and server is solely defined by the responsibilities of each. Thus a given machine can act both as client and server (peer-to-peer scenario) or restrict itself to exactly one of the roles (publish-subscribe scenario).</p>

    <p>The protocol provides no provision against malicious or broken servers. It requires the client to trust all upstream servers.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Protocol</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3 class="title">Terminology</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Server Node: A source of resource descriptions that hosts both feed and data services so other nodes can observe and retrieve the state of the collection being managed.</li>
          <li>Client Node: A node that subscribes to one or more server nodes and implements the update semantics defined in this protocol.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>    
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3 class="title">Server Contract</h3>
        <p>A server node is responsible for providing information about the state of the resource collection(s) it is managing. It provides a number of feeds that allow clients to see which aspects of the collection have changed over time and data services that allow a client to fetch complete representations of the collection or individual resource representations in order to update a client environment.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3 class="title">Feeds & Data Services</h3>
        <p>A compliant server will provide the following Atom 1.0 feeds, resource representation data services and snapshot representation data services.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h4 class="title">Overview Feed</h4>
            <p>The overview feed lists all collections of resource descriptions that are being managed by the server.</p>

            <p>The collections feed comprises a feed consisting of 0 - N feed items. Each feed item represents a collection of resource descriptions that are being exposed by this server.</p>

            <p>Each collection feed item is required to have the mandatory ATOM feed item properties and MUST contain:
            <ul>
                <li>A link element with the following attributes; rel='http://www.egovpt.org/sdshare/collectionfeed', type='application/atom+xml' and href whose value links to the collection feed for that collection.</li>
                <li>An updated element whose value is the date time of the most recently updated item being exposed by the collection.</li>
            </ul>            
            </p>

            <pre>            
Example: 

Http request for server http://sdshare.org:
GET /collections

The Atom payload of the overview feed contains an entry for each separate resource collection. 
Each entry has a link to an Atom feed for the specified collection.

Example response body:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   &lt;feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">

            <h4 class="title">Collection Feed</h4>   
        
            <p>A collection feed is a feed for a specified collection of resource descriptions. A feed of this kinds lists exactly two entries, one entry linking to a snapshots feed and one to an updates feed.</p>
            
            <p>
The Atom payload of the response contains the two entries, one that links to a feed with all snapshots of the collection (rel-attribute of the link is http://www.egovpt.org/sdshare/snapshotsfeed), and another one that links to an Atom feed that lists updates to the resources in the collection (rel-attribute of the link is http://www.egovpt.org/sdshare/fragmentsfeed). Optionally, both links can be duplicated in the entries with rel-attributes that have the value alternate. This can help some Atom feed readers to correctly display the links.      </p>

            <p>A snapshot is the complete RDF data set for a collection at some point in time. The snapshots feed lists all the snapshots that are exposed by this collection. Each entry in the feed represents a single snapshot. The entry must contain a link element that has a rel attribute with value 'http://www.egovpt.org/sdshare/snapshot', a type attribute whose value is 'application/rdf+xml' or 'plain/text+nt' or '...'. It must also have an href attribute that links to the data for the snapshot. The item's updated element should reflect the datetime when the snapshot was taken.</p>

            <h4>Resources Feed</h4>

<p>The resources feed is an Atom feed. The entries of the feed list
resources that have changed in a given time period.</p>

<p>The Atom specification requires all entries to contain
an <tt>id</tt> element, which must be unique. SDshare adds no further
semantics to this element, and clients are advised to avoid depending
on this element.</p>

<p>The Atom payload contains an entry for each updated resource. Each
entry contains one or more links to the resource and
the <tt>updated</tt> element contains the time at which the resource
was updated. Links to the resource must use the <tt>alternate</tt>
link relationship, and can be in different formats identified with
the <tt>type</tt> attribute, allowing clients to choose their
preferred format.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard Atom elements this protocol introduces
one new element.

The new element is:

<tt>&lt;ResourceUri></tt>: Indicates to a client which resource is
being updated from all those present in the resource representation.
This element MUST occur exactly once as a child element of
each <tt>entry</tt>. (See the fragment update algorithm below for more
information).
            </p>

            <p>The resources feed service accepts an optional request parameter called 'since'. This parameter can be used to specify that the client only wishes to see entries for fragments produced after the time given in the parameter. The effect of this parameter is to remove from the response body <entry> elements with timestamps in the atom:updated element older than the given time.</p>

            <p>Note that links to the service in the collection feed will not include this parameter. Clients must therefore add it to the URL themselves should they wish to use it. The value of the parameter is a datetime value matching the format specified in section 3.3 of the Atom specification.</p>

            <pre>

    <p>Supported datatypes are for resource representations are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>application/rdf+xml: Serialization as RDF/XML
    </ul>

<p>As the number of changes made to the collection grows, the number
of entries in the resources feed can become very large. To avoid
returning excessively long responses, the server can page the
resources feed, using the conventions defined in RFC 5005. If the feed
is paged, each page must contain one link element with the "next"
relation type. Other link types may also be provided, but this is not
required.</p>

            <p>Response structure:
                A collection fragment can be represented as a valid XTM 1.0, XTM 2.0 or RDF/XML document.

                The generation of fragments for feeds with RDF/XML payload is described in the RDF subsection below.

                A fragment for a feed with XTM 1.0 or XTM 2.0 payload is created in the context of one or more topics. The following algorithm should be applied when generating a fragment for given topic:

                    Let 'export' mean to create an XTM representation of the TMDM construct
                    Let T be the topic being exported.
                    export T including ALL topicnames, identifiers, and occurrences.
                    for each topicname in T export a topic stub for each name type (if it exists)
                    for each topicname in T export a topic stub for each scope topic (if it exists)
                    for each occurrence in T export a topic stub for the occurrence type (if it exists)
                    for each occurrence in T export a topic stub for each scope topic (if it exists)
                    for each association A in which T plays a role export the association
                    for each association A export a topic stub for the association type
                    for each association A export a topic stub for each topic scope topic
                    for each role R in A export a topic stub for the role type and one for the role player UNLESS the role player is T 

                For each stub topic exported (the following minimum must be exported)

                    export ALL of the topic's identifiers 

                ALL topics (stub or not) MUST have at least one Subject Identifier.

                A server may choose to export more information in the fragment, what is described here is the minimum required.

        <h3 class="title">Client Role</h3>
        <p>There are two aspects to client behaviour. The first is consumption of the feeds provided by the service the second is the updating of the local map based on the fragments it retrieves.</p>


        <div class="section">
            <h4>Initialisation</h4>
            <p>When a client first wants to sync with a server it can use the feeds provided to locate the collection of interest, retrieve its full representation and merge it into the local collection it is managing.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h4>A Clean Replacement</h4>
            <p>If a client has a local collection that contains semantic descriptions from more than one server and wants to fetch and update the latest full collection from ONE source then it MUST do the following. Apply the delete topic algorithm from below, but apply it to all topics in his local collection. Then proceed in terms of 'A Clean Start', by fetching the collections from the originating servers and merging it in.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h4>A partial update</h4>
            <p>Clients wishing to update their local collection as new changes occur on the server, should process the fragments feed for the appropriate collection. The client MUST record the date and time that it last updated its local copy and then find all Atom entries that have an updated value after that time. For each of these, in time order of most distant to most recent it should apply the following update algorithm.</p>

            <h4>The Fragment Update Algorithm</h4>

    Let SP be the value of the ServerSrcLocatorPrefix element in the Atom feed F
    feed F contains E
    entry E references fragment TF
    Let LC be the local collection
    Let T be the topic in LC that has a subjectidentifier that matches SI
    For all names, occurrences and associations in which T plays a role, TMC

        Delete all SrcLocators of TMC that begin with SP
        If the count of srclocators on TMC = 0 then delete TMC 
    Merge in the fragment TF using SP as the base all generated source locators.

    NOTE: To deprecate a topic publish an empty topic

    NOTE: The understanding is that each name, occurrence and association created or modified during the update will in its internal, TMDM-conformant representation have or get item identifiers that act as source locators and start with the ServerSrcLocatorPrefix.

    <li>entry E references fragment TF
    <li>Let LC be the local collection
    <li>Let R be the resource in LC that has a Resource URI that matches the SI
    <li>For all statements where R is either the Subject or the Object
    of the statement STAT
    <ul>
        <li>Delete all SrcLocators of STAT that begin with SP
        <li>If the count of srclocators on STAT = 0 then delete TMC
    </ul>
    <li>Merge in the fragment TF using SP as the base all generated
    source locators.
</ul>      

<p>The above algorithm talks about the SrcLocators of a
Statement. This is not an inherent property in the RDF data
model. This is a required extension for the RDF payload. All
Statements are defined as a subtype of Resource. Thus each RDF
statement (as a Resource) MUST have a list property that is a set of
URI's. This property is called 'SrcLocators' and is used as described
above.</p>

        <h2>Deployment Guidelines and Best Practices (informative)</h2>
        <p>This document defines no normative rules for the correct deployment of network topologies that build on it. However, this section proposes a few best practices to handle recurrent deployment issues.</p>

            <h3>Trust and Security</h3>
        
            <p>The protocol assumes that the syndication of semantic descriptions happens with trusted servers. Importing descriptions from untrusted, potentially malicious sources can have serious repercussions including corrupting the client's data. If the protocol is used in P2P scenarios where every node acts both as server and client, this implies that all partners need to trust each other.</p>

            <p>Should the protocol be used to syndicate confidential data, it can be combined with end-to-end encryption between nodes, typically over https. Furthermore, it can leverage existing authentication mechanisms such as basic access authentication over http or https. In particularly sensitive cases it can also be employed over dedicated network connections.</p>
