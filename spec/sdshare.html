<h2 class="title">Abstract</h2>

<p>
SDShare is a protocol for the syndication of resource descriptions. It
defines how a RESTful service can publish a series of feeds that list
snapshots and changes to collections of resources. This protocol also
defines how a client should process those feeds and the linked
resource descriptions so that a local store can be kept in sync.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This specification describes how one RDF system can maintain a
local copy of master data contained in another RDF system. The master
data will change over time. This protocol defines how the master data
server can publish the changes to the resources it manages and how a
client can consume them to ensure it is in sync.</p>

<p>
SDShare also specifies how a client should interpret and process these
feeds in order to consume the resource descriptions. A client that
wishes to maintain a local resource collection in sync with one held
on the server first fetches the most recent snapshot for the required
collection. It then subscribes to the update feed for that
collection. This feed lists the resources whose state has changed in
the underlying resource collection. A client can retrieve the RDF for
a updated resource and update its local collection.</p>

<p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Conceptual Model</h2>

<p>A <dfn>server</dfn> is a node which exposes feeds so that other
nodes can observe and retrieve the state of the data being exposed by
the server.

<p>A <dfn>client</dfn> is a node which subscribes to one or more
feeds and implements the update semantics defined in this
protocol. It is possible for the same node to be both a server and a
client at the same time.</p>

<p>An SDShare server exposes a set of collections.
A <dfn>collection</dfn> is a coherent data set, defined by the server
in any way it sees fit. When exposing an RDF data store via SDShare, a
natural set of collections to use is to let each graph be a
collection, but any set of collections is allowed.</p>

<p>A <dfn>snapshot</dfn> is a complete representation of a collection
as it existed at some point in time.</p>

<p>A <dfn>resource description</dfn> is a complete representation of a
single resource that exists in a collection.</p>

<p>A <dfn>fragments feed</dfn> exposes a list of the resources that
have been modified in the collection.</p>

</div>
  
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Protocol</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="title">Server Role</h3>

<p>An SDShare server SHOULD publish the following hierarchy of Atom
feeds to expose one or more collection(s) of resource descriptions:</p>
      
<ul>
  <li>An overview feed which lists the collections of resource
  descriptions that the server exposes.</li>
  <li>A collection feed for each collection of resource descriptions
  that each links to a corresponding snapshots feed and a
  corresponding fragments feed.</li>
  <li>A snapshots feed for each collection. Each snapshot represents
  the state of a collection at point of time.</li>
  <li>A fragment feed for each collection. Each feed entry exists to
  reflect that the referenced resource has been updated. </li>
</ul>

<p>An SDSshare server SHOULD also provide resource descriptions and
snapshots when requested. Note that these MAY be provided from a
different node.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="title">Overview Feed</h4>

<p>The overview feed lists all collections exposed by the server. It
MUST contain exactly one entry per collection. Each entry MUST contain
a <tt>link</tt> element with a link relation of 
<tt>http://www.sdshare.org/2012/core/collectionfeed</tt>,
<tt>type</tt> set to <tt>application/atom+xml</tt>, and
an <tt>href</tt> whose value links to the collection feed for that
collection.
            
<p>To conform with the Atom specification the link must also be
duplicated with link relation <tt>alternate</tt>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4 class="title">Collection Feed</h4>   
        
<p>A collection feed lists exactly two entries, one entry linking to a
snapshots feed and one to a fragments feed.</p>
            
<p>
The Atom feed MUST contain exactly two entries, one that links to a

<div class="section">
<h4 class="title">Snapshots Feed</h4>

<p>The snapshots feed lists all the snapshots of a collection that are
exposed by a server. Each entry in the feed represents a single
snapshot. The entry MUST contain at least one <tt>link</tt> element
with a link relation
of <tt>http://www.sdshare.org/2012/core/snapshot</tt> and a
<tt>type</tt> attribute specifying the format of the snapshot. It must
also have an <tt>href</tt> attribute that links to the data for the
snapshot. The entry's <tt>updated</tt> element MUST reflect the time
when the snapshot was taken. To conform with the Atom specification
the link must also be duplicated with link
relation <tt>alternate</tt>.</p>

<p>In cases where the snapshot is very large the server MAY expose an
additional link to a chunked snapshot feed, with link relation
<tt>http://www.sdshare.org/2012/core/chunked-snapshot</tt> and
type <tt>application/atom+xml</tt>. The chunked snapshot feed will
contain a list of atom entries where each one links to part of the
data.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>Fragments Feed</h4>
            
<p>The fragments feed is an Atom feed listing resources that have
changed in a given time period. The order of the entries is
undefined.</p>

<p>The Atom content contains an entry for each updated, deleted, or
created resource. Each entry contains one or more links to the
fragment and the <tt>updated</tt> element contains the time at which
the resource was updated. Links to the fragment must use
the <tt>http://www.sdshare.org/2012/core/fragment</tt> link
relationship, and can be in different formats identified with
the <tt>type</tt> attribute, allowing clients to choose their
preferred format. To conform with the Atom specification the link must
be duplicated with link relation alternate.</p>

<p>This protocol introduces one new Atom extension element called
<tt>resource</tt> in the namespace
<tt>http://www.sdshare.org/2012/core/</tt>. The <tt>resource</tt>
element indicates to a client which resource is being updated from all
those present in the fragment.  This element MUST occur exactly once
as a child element of each <tt>entry</tt>.
</p>

<p>The fragments feed service MUST accept an optional request
parameter called <tt>since</tt>. This parameter is be used to specify
that the client only wishes to see entries for fragments produced,
modified or deleted after the time given in the parameter. The effect
of this parameter is to remove from the response body <tt>entry</tt>
elements with timestamps in the <tt>updated</tt> element older than
the given time. The value of the parameter is a datetime value
matching the format specified in section 3.3 of the Atom
specification.</p>

<p>Note that links to the service in the collection feed will not
include this parameter. Clients must therefore add it to the URL
themselves should they wish to use it.</p>

<p>As the number of changes made to the collection grows, the number
of entries in the fragment feed can become very large. To avoid
returning excessively long responses, the server MAY page the fragment
feed, using the conventions defined in RFC 5005. If the feed is paged,
each page MUST contain one link element with the "next" relation type.
Other link types MAY also be provided.</p>

<p>For RDF data, the set of statements S making up the fragment for a
resource R in a collection corresponding to a graph G is produced by
the following algorithm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Include in S all statements in G in which R is the subject.</li>
  <li>For all statements in S where the object is a blank node B, find
  all statements with B as the subject, and add those statements to
  S. Repeat recursively with all B's statements. </li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h3 class="title">Client Role</h3>

<p>This section describes the most common operations performed by
SDShare clients, and some minimal requirements for client behaviour.
This specification does not restrict what clients may do with the data
they retrieve.</p>

<p>The client generally updates a local collection with data from a
remote collection using the SDShare feeds. A local collection is
typically considered to be an RDF graph but can be some other local
data store such as a relational database or archiving system. The
client often starts off with no local data, and would then typically
begin by retreiving a snapshot and loading that into the local
collection. Thereafter, the client waits for resources to appear on
the fragments feed. When an entry appears on the fragments feed, the
local representation of that resource is deleted and the new
representation offered by the server is loaded in its place.</p>

<p>While processing, the client MUST keep track of the time of the
last update it has seen, called <tt>t</tt>. Initially, <tt>t</tt> is
not set.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>Snapshot Processing</h4>

<p>To process a snapshot, the client should first delete the local
copy of the collection (if it has one). The snapshot can then be
downloaded from the server, and written into the local collection.</p>

<p>If the server exposes a chunked snapshot feed, the client should
use it. For each entry in the feed the client should use the
approperiate link to retrieve the snapshot chunk and load it into the
local collection.</p>

<p>Once a snapshot has been processed successfully, <tt>t</tt> MUST be
set to the time in the <tt>updated</tt> element of the snapshot entry
that was processed.</p>

<p>The chunked snapshot feed and the complete snapshot data MAY be
produced asynchronously by the server. If this is the case, the server
may return an HTTP 202 response code, in which case the client MUST
wait, and retry the same request until it receives an HTTP 200
response.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4>Fragment Processing</h4>

<p>A client wishing to update its local collection as new changes
occur on the server, should process the fragments feed for the
appropriate collection. For each fragment, the clients should delete
its local copy of the fragment, and then replace it with the new
fragment from the server. Section 5.2.3 describes a simple update
algorithm for RDF data stores.</p>

<p>In the case where the fragments feed is paged, as described in Atom
Specification 3.3, then the client should follow the <tt>next</tt>
links to find the rest of the fragments.</p>

<p>Once all fragments have been successfully processed, the client
MUST set <tt>t</tt> to the highest (that is, latest) value observed in
the <tt>updated</tt> element of any fragment entry. If <tt>t</tt> has
a value when fragment processing begins, the client MUST pass it in
the <tt>since</tt> parameter described in section 5.1.4.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h4>A Fragment Update Algorithm for RDF Stores</h4>

<p>Each Atom entry contains a <tt>resource</tt> element, which
identifies which resource is to be updated. We call this resource
R.</p>

<p>The Atom entry provides a set of links with link relation
<tt>http://www.sdshare.org/2012/core/fragment</tt> referring to
different representations of the resource. It is up to the client to
choose which link to follow, based on the <tt>type</tt> attribute.</p>

<p>The link is used to retrieve a set of RDF statements that are the
new representation of the resource R. We call this set of statements
S. These statements are to be written to a graph G, where G is
determined by the client.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow the fragment generation algorithm in section 5.1.5 for R
  in G, and call the resulting set of statements S'.</li>
  <li>Delete all statements in S' from G.</li>
  <li>Insert all statements in S into G.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Recommended Resource Representation Formats</h3>

<p>Any formats may be used for resource representations, but the
following are recommended:</p>
    
<ul>
  <li>RDF/XML (application/rdf+xml)</li>
